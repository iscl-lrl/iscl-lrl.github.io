This is the course page
for the summer semester 2023 seminar on
_Tools for Resources for Low-resource Languages_
at the [Department of Linguistics](http://sfs.uni-tuebingen.de),
[University of Tübingen](http://uni-tuebingen.de).

During the past few decades, natural language processing (NLP) has seen 
a strong shift towards data-driven methods. A similar shift is also
observed in linguistics research, where data-driven, quantitative
approaches have been replacing some of the earlier methodologies.
However, there is a strong imbalance between the languages of the 
world with respect to the availability of tools and resources for NLP
and linguistic research.

This is a project-based course where the participants learn by
developing tools or linguistic resources for low-resource settings.
The typical resources include treebanks, and lexical resources. Creation
of annotated datasets for particular NLP applications, evaluating
and/or extending available, but limited resources and tools, and
experiments with dealing with low-resource scenarios (e.g., transfer
learning, data augmentation, distant supervision) are also possible
areas to focus on this course.

The course can be taken for 3, 6 and 9CP.
